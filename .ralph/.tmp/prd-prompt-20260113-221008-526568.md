You are an autonomous coding agent.
Use the $prd skill to create a Product Requirements Document in JSON.
Save the PRD as JSON in directory: /home/ralph/ClaudeCoder/.agents/tasks
Filename rules: prd-<short-slug>.json using 1-3 meaningful words.
Examples: prd-workout-tracker.json, prd-usage-billing.json
Do NOT implement anything.
After creating the PRD, end with:
PRD JSON saved to <path>. Close this chat and run `ralph build`.

User request:
A Claude Code configuration system combining: (1) Ralph-style file-based agent loop - files/git as memory, one story per iteration, completion signal pattern, fresh context each run; (2) Lifecycle hooks (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop); (3) Deterministic quality gates (tests, lint, types, todos) that block completion; (4) Guardrails/Signs system for learned failure modes injected each iteration; (5) Skills for planning, execution, review, and debugging; (6) Append-only progress logging; (7) PRD-driven story management with status tracking. Target: Claude Code CLI with Codex as optional secondary agent.
