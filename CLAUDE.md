# Plan-Driven Execution Guide

## Classification Rules
- Trivial work: single, obvious change with no ambiguity and no need to explore options. Execute directly without a plan.
- Open-ended work: multi-step, ambiguous, or requires discovery/coordination. Create a plan first.

Use the plan template at `plans/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` for open-ended work and keep it focused on one goal per iteration.

## Iteration Loop
1. Read the relevant plan and restate the goal in your own words.
2. Mark the next task as in progress and execute the minimal change set.
3. Verify the result with the required checks or tests.
4. Update the plan with what changed and any decisions.
5. Mark tasks complete and end with the completion signal.

Why this loop: it keeps scope tight, documents intent, and ensures verification before declaring completion.
